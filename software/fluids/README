navier2d - solves Navier-Stokes in 2D periodic boundary conditions.
navier3d - solves Navier-Stokes in 3D periodic boundary conditions.
navier3d-mag - solves Navier-Stokes in 3D periodic boundary conditions,
also computing the so called magnetization variables:
  dm/dt = viscosity laplacian m - u . grad m - m . transpose(grad u)
(so u = leray-projection of m).
