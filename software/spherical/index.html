<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Spherical Package</h1>

<p>This software solves partial differential equations on the two dimensional
sphere such as the Jeffery's equation for fiber orientation distributions.
The software is described at
<a href="https://stephenmontgomerysmith.github.io/preprints/pde-sphere.html">https://stephenmontgomerysmith.github.io/preprints/pde-sphere.html</a> and <a href="pde-sphere-software.pdf">pde-sphere-software.pdf</a>.</p>

<p>The version of the software described in the paper is spherical-2.26.
The most recent version of the software is spherical-3.13.
It is substantially faster than version 2.26, and includes several corrections.  (Note versions of spherical-3.xx for xx less than 12 have a serious bug.)</p>

<p>(Version 3.01 comes in a "cuda" version that is capable of using nvidia
graphics cards. This only works for the Folgar-Tucker equation,
and seems to be unreliable.)</p>

<p>It may be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/stephenmontgomerysmith/spherical">here</a>.</p>

<p>This work was supported by the National Science Foundation NSF CMMI 0727399.</p>
