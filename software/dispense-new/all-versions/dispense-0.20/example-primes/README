count-primes takes as an input a number b, 0<=b<100,000, and computes the
number of primes p between 1,000,000,000 b and 1,000,000,000 (b+1) for which
p-a_1, p-a_2, ...., p-a_n are also prime, for various lists a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.

To create the program, create a file list.  Each line contains a list of
numbers which is one of these lists.  So for example, list could be the two
lines

2
4 6

Then typing "make" will create a program count-primes that after accepting
b, will output two numbers, the first being the number of primes p between
1,000,000,000 b and 1,000,000,000 (b+1) for which p-2 is also prime (so called
twin primes), and the second being the number of primes p for which p-4 and 
p-6 are also prime.

After using the dispense program to create an output file, you can analyse
(basically total it up) with the script analyse-output.  This script
expects the file list (the same one used in the make process) to be present
in the current directory.

make-html takes the output of analyse-output, and makes it into a web page.

Note: the list file that currently is here makes a program that puts a lot
of strain on the compiler.  (It is a concatonation of the outputs from
make-list1 and make-list2.)  If the compilation fails because of lack of space,
consider reducing the size of list.
