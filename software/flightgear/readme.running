Starting the executable
=======================

Unix:    runfgfs
Windows: runfgfs.bat

"runfgfs" is a script which runs the Flight Gear executable with
(hopefully) the correct $FG_ROOT directory specified.


Keyboard controls
=================

Flying is mainly done via the numeric keypad.  There is some
unresolved wierdness with the GLUT libraries and keyboard input, so
for now, the state of the "Num Lock" key is important.
