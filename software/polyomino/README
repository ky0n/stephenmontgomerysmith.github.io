This is the software I used to compute the number of ways of solving
polyomino puzzles.  The later versions of the software have some
small changes and bugs removed (the bugs don't seem to have affected
the veracity of the numbers --- so far).  The earlier versions are
what I actually used.

The poly(n)omino programs do a depth first search looking for solutions.
(For a while I misspelt polyomino.)

The poly-net programs spread the problem out to allow many computers
to work on different parts of the problem.  This is currently set up
for the problem of placing the tetrominoes and pentominoes into a
10x8 rectangle.  For a single 1GHz computer this computation would
have taken about half a year.  I spread the problem amongst about
140 computers, and it took a few days to show that there were 
3386001688 solutions.  The file save-results shows the intermediate
computations.

The patch polyomino.h-patch-0.4-1 applied to polyomino-0.4 seems to give
quite a speed increase.
