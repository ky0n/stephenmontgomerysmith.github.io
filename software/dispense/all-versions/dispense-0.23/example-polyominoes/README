This is a suite of programs designed to count the number of ways to solve
various polyomino puzzles.  The *-create-input programs are designed to
be inputs to the dispense program, and the *-client programs are designed
to be executed by the enact program.  The program analyse-output will give
the grand total.

These programs were derived from the polyomino-0.4 package available at
http://www.math.missouri.edu/~stephen/software/#polyominoes
