01-04/02 - Version 0.19

01/03/02 - Added example-polyominoes.

01/03/02 - Doc changes.

01/01/02 - Version 0.18

01/01/02 - Very minor fix to analyse-output in example-primes.

12/31/01 - Version 0.17

12/31/01 - Added check for duplicates in filter-input.

12/31/01 - Had dispense put "Starting" message on stdout rather than stderr.

12/31/01 - Removed test for success on the second setpgid in open_program*,
           because it seems to fail if the first setpgid executes first.

12/31/01 - Reorganized the code in enact-utilities concerning what happens
           if a connection is aborted.

12/30/01 - Added call to setsockopt to set REUSEADDR in dispense, and then
           decided to remove it for security reasons.

12/30/01 - Version 0.16

12/30/01 - dispense calls sets USR2 signal again after a USR2 signal has been
           processed (I guess some Unices reset the signal manager otherwise.)

12/30/01 - Added start message to dispense.

12/30/01 - Removed a bug in example-primes/make-count-primes.

12/29/01 - Rewrote a lot of example-primes to make it more efficient.

12/28/01 - Version 0.15

12/28/01 - Added example-primes directory.

12/28/01 - Changed open_program and open_program_pty so that stderr is no
           longer attached to /dev/null in the child process.

12/28/01 - Imposed a 50,000 character limit on the length of the input and
           output lines sent via TCP/IP.

12/28/01 - Created tcpio, a rather simple stdio type package.  I did this
           because I read somewhere that one should not rely on stdio being
           secure when reading from untrusted sources.

12/28/01 - Check that output of accept is non-negative in dispense.c.

12/27/01 - Version 0.14

12/27/01 - Used O_NONBLOCK in bipipeio, so as to remove the need for limited
           size writes.

12/26/01 - Renamed my-stdio to bipipeio, and renamed a lot of the functions
           therein.

12/26/01 - 1024 becomes PIPE_BUF in my-stdio.c.

12/24/01 - Completely wrote my-stdio which seems to work better with pipes
           than stdio.  pipe-utilities.c is replaced by open-program.c.

12/23/01 - Minor fixes in pipe-utilities.c.

12/17/01 - Fixed bug in which dispense exits if dispense.allow is malformed
           and usr does killall -USR2 dispense.
