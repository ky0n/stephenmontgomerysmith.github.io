<B>Stephen Montgomery-Smith&#44; Hamiltonians representing equations of motion with damping due to friction.</B>
<I>Electron. J. Diff. Equ., Vol. 2014 (2014), No. 89, pp. 1-10.</I>
Suppose that \(H(q,p)\) is a Hamiltonian on a manifold \(M\), and \(\tilde L(q,\dot q)\), the Rayleigh dissipation function, satisfies the same hypotheses as a Lagrangian on the manifold \(M\).  We provide a Hamiltonian framework that gives the equations
\(\dot q  = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p}\),
\(\dot p = - \frac{\partial H}{\partial q} - \frac{\partial \tilde L}{\partial \dot q}\).
The method is to embed \(M\) into a larger framework where the motion drives a wave equation on the negative half line, where the energy in the wave represents heat being carried away from the motion.  We obtain a version of N&ouml;ther's Theorem that is valid for dissipative systems.  We also show that this framework fits the widely held view of how Hamiltonian dynamics can lead to the "arrow of time."
