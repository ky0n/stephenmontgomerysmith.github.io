<B><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/djg/">David Greaves</a> and Stephen Montgomery-Smith&#44; Unforgeable Marker Sequences.</B>
<I>(Computer Science)</I>
A binary number of <i>n</i> bits consists of an ordered sequence of <i>n</i> digits taken from the set {0,1}.  A sequence is said to be an unforgeable marker if all subsequences of consecutive digits starting at the left-hand end are dissimilar from the sequence of the same length which ends at the right-hand end.  Unforgeable marker sequences are so called because, when misaligned in a shift-register or other view port of the correct length, there is no possibility of adjacent random digits impersonating the true sequence.  Such sequences are used for frame alignment purposes in serial data communications systems.

Since we wrote this paper, we found out that these sequences had been studied by others, as <i>bifix-free</i> words, or as <i>autocorrelations</i>.  We refer the reader to <a href="https://oeis.org/A003000">On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences A003000</a> and <a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~sillke/SEQUENCES/autocorrelation">http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~sillke/SEQUENCES/autocorrelation</a>.
