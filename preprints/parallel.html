<B>Stephen Montgomery-Smith&#44; Control of systems by parallel actuators.</B>
<I>WSEAS Transactions on Systems and Control, vol. 17, pp. 207-213, 2022.</I>
We describe a particular control method for a system controlled by several actuators with the same control constants.  We show under certain assumptions that the control constants for the whole system can be obtained immediately from the control constants for a single actuator.  This greatly simplifies the work in finding the control constants.  Also, no gain scheduling is required.  The authors have been unable to find any prior work in this direction, and so believe this is a rather new approach.
