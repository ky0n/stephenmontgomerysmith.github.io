<I>Journal of Enhanced Heat Transfer, 22 (6): 485â€“502 (2015).</I>
Effects of initial conditions on the oscillatory flow in oscillating heat pipes (OHPs) are investigated numerically. Initial vapor temperature, pressure and liquid displacement are in consideration. Three test cases are solved with different initial condition settings. Liquid displacement and vapor temperature tendencies are compared to find which initial condition lead to the best heat transfer performance in all test cases. Fast Fourier transform is employed to calculate the frequency based on liquid displacement. The results show that initial condition has significant effect on oscillating heat pipe performance and keeping initial condition uniform is an effective way for heat transfer enhancement of the system.
