<B>George P. Smith, Miriam Golomb, Sidney K. Billstein and Stephen Montgomery-Smith&#44; An Enduring Legacy: The Luria-Delbrück Fluctuation Test as a
Classroom Investigation in Darwinian Evolution.</B>
<I>American Biology Teacher, Volume 77 (8), October 2015.</I>
Microbial cultures swiftly adapt to lethal agents such as antibiotics or viruses by acquiring resistance
mutations. Does this remarkable adaptability require a Lamarckian explanation, whereby the agent
specifically directs resistance mutations? Soon after the question arose, Luria and Delbrück devised a
clever experiment, the <I>fluctuation test</I>, that answered this question in the negative: microbial adaptation,
they showed, is entirely consistent with a Darwinian explanation. Their 1943 article is a classic of biology
literature, with practical and theoretical implications that continue to expand today. Implementing an
updated fluctuation test in a college teaching lab provides a simple experimental setting in which
beginning students learn to apply basic principles of evolutionary biology and scientific reasoning, while
gaining hands-on experience in core technical advances of contemporary life science.
