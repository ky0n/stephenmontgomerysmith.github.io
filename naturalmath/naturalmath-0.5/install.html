Natural Math is a program that takes mathematics written in a natural way
and typesets it (using LaTeX). For example, you could create a file test.nat
with the lines
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; integral from 0 to infinity of e ^ (-x^2/2) dx
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = sqrt (pi over 2)</TT></PRE>
Then you type
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naturalmath test</TT></PRE>
which will produce a file test.tex ready for LaTeX to typeset it into a
beautiful equation:
<p>
<center><img WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="46" src="img1.gif"
alt="This is an image of the above equation when it is typeset"></center>
<p>
How to use it is described in more detail in the <a href="tutor">tutorial</a>.
<p>
You can try it out from your web browser by connecting to this
<a href="http://cauchy.math.missouri.edu/~stephen/cgi-bin/naturalmath.cgi">site</a>.

<P>This program was originally written to help disabled students
write mathematics. The advantage
of Natural Math over TeX/LaTeX/AMSTeX is that it is easy to learn Natural Math, and
easy to type Natural Math with one hand or with a voice dictation system.
(The advantage of TeX/LaTeX/AMSTeX is that one has many more options available - Natural
Math is not recommended for writing math/science papers.)  (Recently it has been
pointed out to me that groff has a similar looking interface.)

<P>Natural Math is free software.  You may use it under Stephen's version of the
<a href="Stephens-Artistic.txt">Artistic License</a>,

for the original "Artistic License".)
I would like to thank the
<a href="http://www.nsf.gov">NSF</a> for providing support whilst this sofware
was being developed.

<P>The current version of Natural Math is about 0.5.
Please email bug reports to me
at 
<a href="mailto: stephen@math.missouri.edu">stephen@math.missouri.edu</a>.
Please also tell me about any bug fixes or enhancements you make.

<P>Here are the files required, and the tutor.
To run it, you will need Perl version 5
installed on your system. You will also need LaTeX version 2e in order
to make use of the output from the program Natural Math.  I give some 
suggestions as to where to get these packages in the instructions below.

<p>
The Windows/DOS package consists of the files
<br><A HREF="naturalmath.pl">naturalmath.pl</A>
(the perl script),
<br><A HREF="naturalmath.bat">naturalmath.bat</A>
(the batch file),
<br><A HREF="tutor.nat">tutor.nat</A>
(the tutorial),
<br><a href="example.nat">example.nat</a>
(an example .nat file, described in the tutorial),
<br><a href="install.html">install.html</a>
(installation instructions in html - what you are reading now),
<br><a href="Stephens-Artistic.txt">Stephens-Artistic.txt</a>
(my version of the Artistic License)
<br><a href="GNU-GPL.txt">GNU-GPL.txt</a>
(the GNU General Public License).

<p>
The UNIX package consists of
<br><A HREF="naturalmath">naturalmath</A>
(the perl script),
<br><A HREF="tutor.nat">tutor.nat</A>
(the tutorial),
<br><a href="example.nat">example.nat</a>
(an example .nat file, described in the tutorial),
<br><a href="install.html">install.html</a>
(installation instructions in html - what you are reading now),
<br><a href="Stephens-Artistic.txt">Stephens-Artistic.txt</a>
(my version of the Artistic License)
<br><a href="GNU-GPL.txt">GNU-GPL.txt</a>
(the GNU General Public License).

<p>(Note that naturalmath and naturalmath.pl are exactly the same.)

<p>Also available is the CGI script <a href="naturalmath-cgi.txt">naturalmath.cgi</a>
that is used at this 
<a href="http://cauchy.math.missouri.edu/~stephen/cgi-bin/naturalmath.cgi">site</a>.

<p>You can get all of these in compressed format in
<a href="naturalmath-0.5.tar.gz">naturalmath-0.5.tar.gz</a>
or
<a href="naturalmath-0.5.zip">naturalmath-0.5.zip</a>.

<p>
Optional extras (derived files/directories that
need not be distributed with the above files, but still
covered by the copyright):
<br><A HREF="tutor.tex">tutor.tex</A>
(the tutorial as a LaTeX file),
<br><A HREF="tutor.dvi">tutor.dvi</A>
(the tutorial as a dvi file),
<br><A HREF="tutor.ps">tutor.ps</A>
(the tutorial as a postscript file),

How to install Natural Math in Windows 9x</H3>

The program Natural Math requires two things: Perl version 5, and LaTeX
version 2e. If you have these already installed, you are doing great, and
you can skip the next few steps.

<P>One place to install Perl from is the web site <A HREF="http://www.ActiveState.com/ActivePerl/">http://www.ActiveState.com/ActivePerl/</A>.
At the time of this writing, it has a version 509, and a trial version
513. I guess that version 509 is the way to go for now. If you are running
Windows 95, you should follow the link provided in the above web site to
the Microsoft web site <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom1_2/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom1_2/default.asp</A>
This will provide you with a patch to Windows 95 that is required for ActivePerl.

<P>Installing these programs is a breeze - just click on the executables
(do the DCOM1_2 program first), answer a few simple questions (like where
you want it installed - if you can't figure out the questions about Explorer
don't worry about it), and don't forget to reboot your machine after installing
each piece of software.

<P>Next, you need to install TeX. I like miktex, which is available from
a large number of ftp sites, the so called CTAN sites. You can get a list
of them by searching for CTAN in any search engine. The one I used was
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/">ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/</A>.
After getting to whichever ftp site you want, look in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/systems/win32/miktex/1.11/">systems/win32/miktex/1.11/</A>
Personally, I would get the basic system, so download the file <A HREF="ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/systems/win32/miktex/1.11/basic.exe">basic.exe</A>.
Also get the file <A HREF="ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/systems/win32/miktex/1.11/INSTALL.TXT">INSTALL.TXT</A>.
Probably you should get <A HREF="ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/systems/win32/miktex/1.11/update.exe">update.exe</A>
also, although I did not mess with it myself. Again installation is a breeze.
Double click on the executable. The only trickyish bit is the question
about the local TeX repository - I would go for it, perhaps only changing
the disk drive name if you are going to install on a different disk than
the default. Again, remember to reboot your machine after installing the
system. The file <A HREF="ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/systems/win32/miktex/1.11/INSTALL.TXT">INSTALL.TXT</A>.
also has some additional instructions which probably are not necessary,
but better to be safe than sorry.

<P>Now you are ready to install Natural Math. This is not quite so easy,
because I am not a Windows programmer, so I couldn't make a nice slick
package. First decide which directory to store the program in. These instructions
assume that you chose D:\NATURAL. Put the three files <A HREF="naturalmath.pl">naturalmath.pl</A>,
<A HREF="naturalmath.bat">naturalmath.bat</A> and <A HREF="tutor.nat">tutor.nat</A>
into that directory, as well as the files
<a href="Stephens-Artistic.txt">Stephens-Artistic.txt</a>
and
<a href="GNU-GPL.txt">GNU-GPL.txt</a>.
(To download these files, press the shift key whilst
clicking on the link.) 
If necessary, edit the file <A HREF="naturalmath.bat">naturalmath.bat</A>
to reflect the choice of this directory (currently it is set to work for
D:\NATURAL).

<P>Next, you need to edit C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT on your computer. It will have
some lines in it that look something like:
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path c:\pk204g
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PATH=%PATH%;C:\WSMU\dl;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SET PATH=D:\TEXMF\MIKTEX\BIN;D:\PERL\BIN;%PATH%</TT></PRE>
To one of these lines, you should add D:\NATURAL (upper or lower case -
it does not matter), for example, to the first line:
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; path c:\pk204g;d:\natural</TT></PRE>
You need to reboot again for these changes to take effect. Now start a
DOS command line window. Go to the directory you put Natural Math into
by, say, typing
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd \natural</TT></PRE>
Now test Natural Math by typing
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naturalmath tutor</TT></PRE>
You should get an output something like
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Natural Math version 0.2alpha, last modified March 19, 1999.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These errors were inserted deliberately.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error: what's this: `These' just before line 604
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1 + 2 over (x + yy) - 11.2235 +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error: right bracket missing just before line 583
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Created tutor.tex from tutor.nat.</TT></PRE>
(Don't worry about the error messages - they are deliberately in the
tutorial to illustrate errors.)

<p>
If you want to run LaTeX, you can do it with the command
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; latex tutor</TT></PRE>
or by the command which will run natural Math and LaTeX in one go:
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naturalmath /l tutor</TT></PRE>
To view the typeset file, start your previewer program. In the case of
miktex you do this by typing
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yap tutor</TT></PRE>
From here you can print out the tutorial by pressing the print buttons.
You may get some error messages indicating that you need to set up the
printer in YAP correctly - if so press the appropriate buttons (sorry I
cannot help you much more here, but a local computer boffin should be able
to help).

<P>In general, you can create any file of type .nat and Natural Math will
process it for you. If you think that it is too much to type all of naturalmath,
you can change the name of naturalmath.bat to, for example, nm.bat, and
now the command to invoke the program will be
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nm filename</TT></PRE>

How to install Natural Math in Unix</H3>

You need to have Perl version 5 and LaTeX version 2e installed on your
system. If you don't have these already installed, it will be a little
hard for me to give complete instructions, as the different versions of
Unix are so, well, different. I use FreeBSD 3.x where this installation
is a breeze via the ports collection.

<P>First you need to install Perl version 5. It is very likely that this
is already installed. To find out, type
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perl -v</TT></PRE>
and hopefully it will report that you have a version number something like
5.005_02. If you get an earlier version, or a "Command not found" error,
you will need to install Perl version 5. Look in <A HREF="http://www.perl.com/pace/pub/perldocs/latest.html">http://www.perl.com/pace/pub/perldocs/latest.html</A>
to find information. (On FreeBSD 2.x install from /usr/ports/lang/perl5.)

<P>Again, it is very likely you have LaTeX installed. Otherwise, it is
available from a a large number of ftp sites, the so called CTAN sites.
You can get a list of them by searching for CTAN in any search engine.
The one I used was <A HREF="ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/">ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/</A>.

<P>The distribution I used was teTeX, which has <I>everything</I>. After
getting to whichever ftp site you want, look in <A HREF="ftp://ftp.duke.edu/tex-archive/systems/unix/teTeX/">systems/unix/teTeX/</A>.
(On FreeBSD install from /usr/ports/print/teTeX.)

<P>Now you are ready to install Natural Math. Put the file <A HREF="naturalmath">naturalmath</A>
anywhere where you put executables (for example /usr/local/bin, or $HOME/bin,
$HOME is your home directory). Find out where your perl is installed with
the command
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which perl</TT></PRE>
and edit the top line of <A HREF="naturalmath">naturalmath</A> appropriately
(now it assumes that perl is in /usr/bin/perl).  You also need to make
sure that the file naturalmath is set to be executable:
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chmod +x /whereeveritis/naturalmath</TT></PRE>
where <TT>/whereeveritis</TT> is the location where you have put the file
naturalmath.


<P>Next, get the file <A HREF="tutor.nat">tutor.nat</A>. You may want to
put this in some place where you put other document files.
You should also get the files
<a href="Stephens-Artistic.txt">Stephens-Artistic.txt</a>
and
<a href="GNU-GPL.txt">GNU-GPL.txt</a>,
and put them somewhere easy to find.

<P>Now test Natural Math by typing
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naturalmath tutor</TT></PRE>
You should get an output something like
<PRE><TT>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is Natural Math version 0.2alpha, last modified March 19, 1999.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These errors were inserted deliberately.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error: what's this: `These' just before line 604

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error: right bracket missing just before line 583
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Created tutor.tex from tutor.nat.</TT></PRE>
(Don't worry about the error messages - they are deliberately in the
tutorial to illustrate errors.)

<p>
If you want to run LaTeX, you can do it with the command
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; latex tutor</TT></PRE>
or by the command which will run natural Math and LaTeX in one go:
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naturalmath -l tutor</TT></PRE>
To view the typeset file, start your previewer program. For example
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xdvi tutor</TT></PRE>
To print the file, use your local dvi printer program, which might be
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dvips tutor</TT></PRE>
or
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dvips tutor -o!lpr</TT></PRE>
In general, you can create any file of type .nat and Natural Math will
process it for you. If you think that it is too much to type all of naturalmath,
you can change (or link) the name of naturalmath to, for example, nm, and
now the command to invoke the program will be
<PRE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nm filename</TT></PRE>
